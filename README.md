# St.Pete Rising 


Developed a full-stack application with CRUD implementations via React Hooks to effortlessly retrieve and utilize a PostgreSQL database to interactively display a robust website of information on future, current, and past urban development locations St. Pete Rising, (which was created and run by my personal friend,) has reported. This was so fufilling to be able to create something that not only I found passion in, but also enabled me to work closer with my friend!
